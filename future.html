		<div  class = "paragraph">
			<p> I hope that in the future I can pursue a career in data analytics using my computer 
				science degree. I quite enjoy statistics, but I also love programming so a career path
				in data analysis seems like a great option to combine the two. Also, I have been 
				researching and writing a paper on the functions of blockchain technology, which has gotten me
				interested in the field. Therefore, another possible future career direction that I would 
				find fascinating would be to design and work on developing blockchain based systems.
